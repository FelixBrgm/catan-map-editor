# Usage
This project was done cause I just needed a nice map editor that can handle complex chance setup.
The whole system depends on pockets. If you have 5 fields you want to fill randomly you can make 1 pocket with a wood tile and a 6 tile in it. All of the 5 fields will be filled with 6 Woods. If you now make 2 pockets - the previous one and one with wheat with 5. there will be a 2 woods with 6's and 2 wheats with 5's and one 50% chance random one.
Think of pockets like real life ones for a give group of fields one random tile with one random number is drawn and removed. If no more tiles or numbers are left the tiles or numbers refilled. This happens till all tiles in a group are filled in.
